But unfortunately for some reason, it is very difficult to do the initial TimescaleDB setup. The provided schema did not work for me. There is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SvenskaSpel/locust-plugins/issues/11&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; for it with possible mitigation and my solution for it. I took the original schema and modified it, so it works out of the box when you include it into docker.
You can find the adjusted schema in my &lt;a href=&quot;%5Blocust-timescaledb/schema.sql%20at%20main%20%C2%B7%20ludeknovy/locust-timescaledb%20%C2%B7%20GitHub%5D(https://github.com/ludeknovy/locust-timescaledb/blob/main/schema.sql)&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then build it: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;docker build -t timescale .&lt;/code&gt;
And run the docker image: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password timescale&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can use the prepared TimescaleListener from locust-plugins repository. To include it in your test all you have to do is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;@events.init.add_listener&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-@events.init.add_listener&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-@events.init.add_listener&quot;&gt;def on_locust_init(environment, **_kwargs):
    TimescaleListener(env=environment, testplan=„timescale_listener_ex“, target_env=„myTestEnv“)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might need to provide a user and password in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;create_dbconn&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;TimescaleListener&lt;/code&gt; and set up &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;PGHOST&lt;/code&gt; env var.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you are all set up and you can start your test and new records should start popping up in TimescaleDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize the results you have to connect your TimescaleDB to
Grafana. The team behind locust-plugins has prepared a dashboard definition you can easily import and have a very robust monitoring solution for your performance tests.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Test Automation Strategy for REST APIs]]></title><description><![CDATA[Test strategy example for building test harness focused on testing REST APIs]]></description><link>https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/test-automation-strategy-for-rest-api/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/test-automation-strategy-for-rest-api/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 02:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Writing down even a short test (automation) strategy should come before any actual implementation. This document can help you to show to your boss and other team members that you have a plan and the action you make are on purpose. Last but not least it can help to get others involved in the whole process and make it rather a team effort instead of a one-man/woman show. The following text is a model test strategy I used for building a test automation framework for testing microservices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide quick and reliable feedback on newly pushed changes into VSC with the aim of preventing regression function and non-functional bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective authoring of tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fulfill its mission the testing framework and authored tests must fulfill the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated tests should cover the most business-critical parts of the tested system as these tests provide the biggest value by risk mitigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated tests must be reliable and their outcome deterministic. If any of the tests does not adhere to this, it must be located and either fixed or disabled quickly. The testing framework should support this by providing statistics on test metadata and provide an overview of most often failing tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In case one of the tests fails, the testing framework must provide as much information as possible, that allows easy investigation and fast issue location. In practice, this means using the „fail messages” in assertions, central logging, and other practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is necessary to treat test automation code as any other production code and use the same development practices to ensure the test automation efforts will keep maintainable over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functional automated tests should run fast and the testing framework should support parallel test execution. Nonetheless, the test execution speed should not come at the cost of test execution reliability. It is better to have a slower test, that is reliable than a fast test providing a flaky outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The outcome of automation efforts is a docker image published in the docker registry for easy and quick integration into the CI/CD tool. The testing framework must supports parametrization via environment variables. The list of variables must be documented in the readme.md file in the project repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test framework must implement the request signature to allow easy request tracing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test stack must include reporting tool to allow further results aggregation and analysis and sharing additional test information to allow straightforward exploration of a failed test. Here is a couple of metrics the logged data should answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execution time per individual test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pass/Fail ration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flaky tests overview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What projects/tests suites are executed most frequently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the upcoming post, we will have a look at what tools can help us achieve the above-defined strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Decoupling E2E tests]]></title><description><![CDATA[Thoughts on how we can make E2E tests more valuable]]></description><link>https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/decoupling-e2e-tests/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/decoupling-e2e-tests/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2020 02:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I was being interviewed for a QA role by a startup company. When I asked what was their test strategy the interviewer replied that they automate all the scenarios with Cypress. To me it was a red flag for several reasons, thus I started to ask more questions. But the only response I got from the interviewer was - how do I know its all working unless it’s tested this way (through the UI). For some reason, I think this is the byword for testing in many people’s minds - test everything through the UI. All of this happened in 2020, that’s exactly 5 years after &lt;a href=&quot;https://testing.googleblog.com/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just Say No to More End-To-End Tests&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was published. Five years in tech is like an eternity. And still, we (as a testing community) tend to put E2E tests as a cornerstone for our test strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not saying an end to end test are evil, they still can have its place in today’s test strategies, but they should be used wisely and on an appropriate scale. The biggest issue I had with them is that they are very expensive to debug and they have very high requirements on our (testing) infrastructure to avoid all possible timeouts and hiccups. This includes servers running our backend service, CDN, database, and others. The „how do you know its’ all working“ is, on one hand, the biggest selling point of E2E tests to many people but on the other, the complexity is their biggest drawback. Imagine our E2E „login“ test fails. There are endless possibilities of what could go wrong - CSS issue(button is not visible), API not responding, API interface changed but UI logic was not updated accordingly, maybe just some infrastructure issue, or an issue with a database schema, and so on. Although the „login“ test mitigates very specific business risk, it does so very ambiguously. In 2020 we need our tests to be much more targeted and isolated to decrease their run-time and the time needed for debugging. Put it in other words, we need our tests to be much more effective as we develop and deliver software at a higher pace than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microservice architecture demonstrates the rapid pace of software delivery and development while emphasizing testability and reducing complexity as opposite to monolith applications. All of this is possible because microservices are independent and loosely coupled. This means that one microservice is responsible for very specific business capabilities. Let’s carry the same paradigm to testing. So Instead of performing complex E2E tests (which tests application through several layers), try to decouple it and test each layer separately or in smaller and more manageable parts. The practical way to achieve this would be to mock the API and run our front end application against it. As a result, our UI test would be much faster and resilient and we would cover frontend specific risks only. To cover the other risk, we should also introduce contract tests and API tests. This way we would ensure these two systems (front end and backend) understand each other and the backend application works as expected. These practices in place allow us to test specific risks on the appropriate layer instead of testing them all through one layer only. All of this has one important incidental benefit, we can run these test much earlier in the delivery pipeline (shift left), they can run locally during every opened merge requests, instead of waiting for application deployment to the testing environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Generate intuitive Locust.io reports with Jtl Reporter]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tutorial on how to create Locust.io performance reports.]]></description><link>https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/generate-intuitive-locustio-reports-with-jtl-reporter/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/generate-intuitive-locustio-reports-with-jtl-reporter/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2020 02:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Locust.io is without any doubts an excellent performance testing tool. But by default, it lacks one very important feature - better reporting capabilities. Although out of the box its UI provides charts and label statistics, the charts are not persistent. The label statistics can be downloaded in CSV during or after the test run. The issue with end result CSV statistics is that you lose a significant amount of information - the test progress. If there was any considerable performance drop or error rate spike, you won’t know at what time this had happened. Thus, you won’t be able to correlate it to backend service metrics. At last but not least manual storing and comparing CSV files is counter-intuitive and error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I described in another article I had a very similar issue with JMeter and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/generate-intuitive-jmeter-reports-with-jtlreporter-and-taurus/&quot;&gt;I solved it by implementing Jtl Reporter&lt;/a&gt;. By using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ludeknovy/jtl-reporter&quot;&gt;Jtl Reporter&lt;/a&gt; you will get neat performance reports from your tests with the possibility for convenient comparison, test reports management and easily share it with anyone on your team (now you can get rid of HTML reports).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily Locust.io is very hackable by its nature, and extending it is easy thanks to its well-documented event API. I have created a listener that collects data during the performance and saves them into JTL file which conforms JMeter format. Here are two caveats regarding the listener  - it was developed for distributed mode and some of the data (latency and connection time) are not available when compared to JMeter output as Locust.io does not provide them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do I get started?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No worries, its fairly easy and straightforward, there is just a couple of things you need to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy Jtl Reporter. Just follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ludeknovy/jtl-reporter#installation-steps&quot;&gt;the installation steps&lt;/a&gt; in the readme of the project repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new project and scenario in your Jtl Reporter instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ludeknovy/python-test-stack-demo/blob/master/jtl_listener.py&quot;&gt;jtl_listener.py&lt;/a&gt; into the root folder with your Locust.io test scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add JtlListener class into your test scripts. This is done by adding these lines to your User class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token decorator annotation punctuation&quot;&gt;@events&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;init&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;add_listener&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;on_locust_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;environment&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;_kwargs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
JtlListener&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;env&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;environment&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload JTL file into Jtl Reporter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ludeknovy/python-test-stack-demo&quot;&gt;demo repository&lt;/a&gt; with a simple test, so you can check it out and try to generate JTL file on your own. Again, simply follow the steps in the readme to install everything and how to run the tests. Do not forget to start PetStore API, otherwise, you will get but errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the test do its job for a while. You should now see JTL file in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;logs&lt;/code&gt; folder in the root folder of the repository.  Take it and upload it to the Jtl Reporter to your project’s scenario and wait for the report. Once processed you will get a report like on the image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an upcoming blog post we will look at how to upload the results to the Jtl Reporter automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy testing!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Code coverage of E2E with Playwright]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tutorial on how to collect code coverage of E2E tests]]></description><link>https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/code-coverage-of-e2e-tests-with-playwright/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/code-coverage-of-e2e-tests-with-playwright/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Sep 2020 02:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing with Playwright for some time, and their documentation (they even have &lt;a href=&quot;https://playwright.tech/blog/tracking-frontend-coverage-with-playwright&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it) gave me an idea of measuring code coverage of E2E tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Playwright?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playwright is one of the newest UI testing tool, which describes itself as a tool “to enable cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast.” (Clearly they market itself as selenium competitor as selenium is often connected with terms like “unreliable” and “slow”) Playwright has great API, auto waits, multiple browser support (Chromium, WebKit, Firefox), intercepting networks, it supports automatic code coverage collection and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why would I need a code coverage of E2E tests?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code coverage metric is widely connected with unit tests. Primarily because it is easy to measure it for unit tests and every decent testing framework supports it out of the box. Code coverage is much less considered when talking about API tests or E2E tests. I bet the main reason is, that it is not so easy to get it - just try to google API code coverage and compare it unit code coverage. In the second case, Google returns many more results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code coverage of E2E tests should not be used for dull 100% coverage goal (as with unit tests), since it may bring more problems than gain. But rather it should be used as an indicator. Indicator of whether we have not forgotten to cover any business critical scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do I get a code coverage?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was using playwright together with Jest. The playwright community contains &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fplaywright-community%2Fjest-playwright&quot;&gt;playwright-jest&lt;/a&gt; template for jest framework. This allows you to create &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;jest-playwright.config.js&lt;/code&gt; where you can set up all playwright settings. In our case, we want to set &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;collectCoverage&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing which is needed to gather code coverage, is to instrument your app. In my case I had to install &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;babel-plugin-istanbul&lt;/code&gt; and add to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;.babelrc&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;env&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;development&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;plugins&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;istanbul&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start your application in the development environment. To confirm you will be able to get coverage, go to console in dev tools, and type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;__coverage__&lt;/code&gt;. If you get an object, you are ready to collect code coverage with your E2E tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add new command to your &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;test:e2e&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;nyc --reporter=html jest&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can choose whatever reporter you want. Istanbul provides plethoras of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm run test:e2e&lt;/code&gt;. And once your test execution finishes you should get console output like this:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report reminds us, that there is one area of the application which is not covered by E2E tests at all. And it’s up to further risk consideration whether it should or not to be included in E2E test suite.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[KPI validation with locust.io]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tutorial on how to create KPI validation for locust.io to automatically check whether application meets performance criteria.]]></description><link>https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/kpi-validation-with-locust/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/kpi-validation-with-locust/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 02:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In performance testing KPIs should be an inherent part of requirements, thus we don’t blindly stress our application. Rather we should have a clear idea of what our stack should handle under defined circumstances. A real-world example of performance requirement could be: “The 90 percentile should be below 50ms while handling 500 RPS (requests per second)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we fine-tuned our application to meet defined performance criteria we can hook up this test into your CI/CD tool and run the same performance test as a part of your delivery pipeline to prevent performance regression. To fully automate the whole process — we want want to look at the results only when the build has failed because of defined KPIs were not met — we need to add the ability to decide whether to pass or fail to our Locust script. Locust doesn’t have this feature baked in, but fortunately, Locust is very hackable and provides a nice API for customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of automated KPI validation we are going to create a custom plugin using locust’s event hooks and its inner statistics. The overall plugin design is pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register quitting event&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get all statistics and serialize them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate missing metrics (RPS, percentiles, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heck provided KPI definition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validate provided KPI agains actual measurements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole KPI plugin code can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ludeknovy/af039ea46d568490cd8d09f5d0dad90d/raw/4c423298df3cd41ff42cc1ce89d78210f7ec9157/kpi_listener.py&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have to register KpiPlugin class within your Locust script and define KPI(s) like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;events&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;init&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;add_listener
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;on_locust_init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;environment&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;_kwargs&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    KPI_SETTINGS &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;/store/inventory&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;percentile_90&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;rps&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;error_rate&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    KpiPlugin&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;env&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;environment&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; kpis&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;KPI_SETTINGS&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above script will make your build fail in case /store/inventory endpoint won’t meet one of the defined criteria — 90 percentile is worse than 50ms, RPS is under 500, error rate is higher than 0%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy performance testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Custom matcher for API definition in Python with PyHamcrest and Schemathesis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tutorial on how to create custom matcher for API response schema using schemathesis and OAS/swagger.]]></description><link>https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/custom-matcher-for-api-definition/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/custom-matcher-for-api-definition/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 02:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the other article, I showed you how to create&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/custom-status-code-matcher/&quot;&gt; custom matcher for API status code&lt;/a&gt;. And today we are going to look at how to do the same for easy and fast testing of API response definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this purpose, we are going to need &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kiwicom/schemathesis&quot;&gt;Schemathesis&lt;/a&gt; library. This tool makes API definition testing very easy. It could be use as CLI or in-code as standard python package. And this is how Schemathesis describes itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schemathesis is a tool for testing your web applications built with Open API / Swagger specifications.
It reads the application schema and generates test cases which will ensure that your application is compliant with its schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Schemathesis can be used not only to assert that API response conforms to API definition but can be used to do property-based testing for specified API input. In this article, we are going to focus only on API response assertions. If you’d like to know more about Schemathesis check this &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.kiwi.com/schemathesis-property-based-testing-for-api-schemas-52811fd2b0a4&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from its author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the previous article we use PyHamcrest for custom matcher implementation. We need to import &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Case&lt;/code&gt; class from schemathesis library to do the actual response definition validation. The following custom matcher implementation assumes usage of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt; library for performing HTTP request. But this could be easily adjusted for any http library of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; hamcrest&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;core&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;base_matcher &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; BaseMatcher
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; requests &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Response
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; schemathesis &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Case

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;SatisfyApiSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;BaseMatcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; schema&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; spec_url_template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_schema &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; schema
        self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_spec_url_template &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; spec_url_template
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_matches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
        method &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;request&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;method

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; KeyError&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; Exception&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string-interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;f&apos;Unable to map url: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_spec_url_template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; with method: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;method&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; to provided schema&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; AssertionError &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; assertError&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; Exception&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;assertError&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;satisfy_api_spec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;schema&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; spec_url_template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; SatisfyApiSpec&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;schema&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; spec_url_template&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This expose &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;satisfy_api_spec&lt;/code&gt; function which can be imported in our test file and used inside PyHamcrest’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;asset_that&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;assert_that&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; satisfy_api_spec&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;schema&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; spec_url_template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;’&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;store&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;order’&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;satisfy_api_spec&lt;/code&gt; accepts two parameters — &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;spec_url_template&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;schema&lt;/code&gt; can be initialized in multiple ways — &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;from_path&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;from_dict&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;from_uri&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;from_file&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;from_wsgi&lt;/code&gt;. And &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;spec_url_template&lt;/code&gt; is API url path template as specified in open api specification. The whole test could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; schemathesis
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; hamcrest &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; assert_that
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; utils&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;matchers&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;response_schema_matcher &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; satisfy_api_spec
schema &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; schemathesis&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;from_uri&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;http://0.0.0.0:8080/swagger.json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;test_get_store_orders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    response &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; requests&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;http://0.0.0.0:8080/store/order&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    assert_that&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
      satisfy_api_spec&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;schema&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  spec_url_template&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;’&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;store&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;order’&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case actual API implementation differs from API definition you will get a validation with detailed error message on which specific property of the actual response does not conform to API definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy API testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Custom status code matcher for API testing in Python with PyHamcrest]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tutorial on how to create custom status code matcher with Python and PyHamcrest]]></description><link>https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/custom-status-code-matcher/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/custom-status-code-matcher/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 02:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Incorporating custom response code matcher in your codebase is going to increase the readability of your tests and make it a little bit more maintainable — transition to another http library would be easier, as you would need to change only custom matcher logic instead of changing assertion of all your tests. But the biggest benefit lies in vastly improved debugging experience and thus reducing the time spent exploring failed tests and gathering informations. In this article I am going to show you how you can achieve this in python using PyHamcrest library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever had written any API automated test you certainly used an assertion for status code to ensure given endpoint behaves correctly. Using build-in python assert statement the very simple test could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;response &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; request&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;https://base_url/endpoint&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;status_code &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at some point the assertion failed and it would produce following assertion error message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
where &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Response &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;status_code&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is ok, but unfortunately it won’t provide you any other information e.g about error returned in response body by the server. We could improve the assert by adding response body as fail message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;response &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; request&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;https://base_url/endpoint&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;status_code &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would produce error message like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;AssertionError&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Any API response body&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
where &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Response &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;status_code&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, that would help a lot for debugging when any test fails, but it is not as clean solution as it could be.To make the code more cleaner we are going to implement custom response status code matcher using PyHamcrest library. This specific custom matcher expects that your test code uses &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt; library for making actual HTTP request, but you can easily adjust it for arbitrary http library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# response_matcher.py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; hamcrest&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;core&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;base_matcher &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; BaseMatcherfrom 
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; requests &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; Response

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ReturnedStatusCode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;BaseMatcher&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; status_code&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_status_code &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; status_code
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;_matches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;status_code&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;status_code &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_status_code
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;describe_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; description&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        description&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append_text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;status code &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        description&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append_description_of&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;_status_code&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;describe_mismatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;self&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; mismatch_description&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        mismatch_description&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append_text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;status code &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        mismatch_description&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append_description_of&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;status_code&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        mismatch_description&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append_text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot; received with body: \n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        mismatch_description&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;append_text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;item&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;text&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;has_returned_status_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;status_code&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; ReturnedStatusCode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;status_code&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we just need to import it and its ready for use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; hamcrest &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; assert_that
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; response_matcher &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; has_returned_status_code

response &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; request&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;get&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;https://base_url/endpoint&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
assert_that&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;response&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; has_returned_status_code&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case of test failure it would now produce following assertion error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot;&gt;AssertionError&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
Expected&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; status code &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    but&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; status code &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; received &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;API response will be printed here&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my eyes &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;assert_that(response, has_returned_status_code(200))&lt;/code&gt; is more elegant solution than &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;assert response.status_code == 200&lt;/code&gt; and providing very useful information for quick change assessment detected by API test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy API testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Generate intuitive JMeter reports with Jtl Reporter and Taurus]]></title><description><![CDATA[Get rid of static JMeter HTML report and manage your test reports with Jtl Reporter]]></description><link>https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/generate-intuitive-jmeter-reports-with-jtlreporter-and-taurus/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.ludeknovy.tech/blog/generate-intuitive-jmeter-reports-with-jtlreporter-and-taurus/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2019 02:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taurus and JMeter became my go-to performance tools very quickly. JMeter is considered to be industry standard with very strong community support and Taurus creates a wrapper around JMeter (and other performance testing tools) and exposes neat abstraction which simplifies the complexity of JMeter and automation. Together they create an incredibly powerful performance testing solution. The only major issue I had with them is inconvenient HTML report and test result management in case you do not want to pay for BlazeMeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, this could be solved by e.g. Grafana and underlying database. While it works very well for storing and visualizing data, it does not work so very well in a comparison of those reports in retrospective views. BlazeMeter provides nice reports which help to mitigate this problem, but unfortunately, I was not able to find any OSS alternative to it. For this reason, I have decided to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ludeknovy/jtl-reporter&quot;&gt;Jtl Reporter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jtl Reporter could be defined as JMeter and Taurus performance result reporting and management tool. Jtl Reporter is meant to be used as an addition to Grafana. And its main objective is to give you the possibility to store test reports and compare them with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Compare test runs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run a couple of measurements and you are ready to start comparing them. Go to test run detail and click “chart icon” in Request statistics card header. You can choose another test run you want it to compare to. After confirmation, you get updated request statistics table.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superscript text numbers indicate whether the current test run result is better (green) or worse (red) compared to the selected test run and what is the difference. If you compare two test runs with either different environments or virtual users (threads) you will get a warning, because such a comparison could be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set test reference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you tuned your application to the desired state you can set the test run as a reference for other tests. This can be achieved by clicking edit button in test detail and checking set as base run. If there is a reference run in a given scenario each test detail will display “rocket” icon in Request Statistics. It gives you a short cut for a quick comparison with a test run reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Track changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To track individual label (endpoint) changes over time you can click blue “chart icon” in Request Statistics table. The chart displays 90, 95 and 99 percentiles trends. You can compare all results (last 100) or filter them by virtual users which gives you a less misleading overview.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to get started ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its easy to get Jtl Reporter up and running with docker-compose. Clone this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ludeknovy/jtl-reporter&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt; and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;docker-compose up -d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait for it to start up and open: &lt;a href=&quot;http://IP_ADDRESS:2020&quot;&gt;http://IP_ADDRESS:2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To log-in use default credentials (change them afterwards):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;username: admin
password: 2Txnf5prDknTFYTVEXjj&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you logged in you have to create a new project and scenario before you can upload any performance tests data. To a create new project click on the user icon at the top menu, then administrate — add project. Enter the project name and confirm. Now you need to obtain an api token by clicking api tokens and then add token. Finally head to project detail by selecting it in projects dropdown at the top menu and click add scenario. Enter the scenario name and confirm. Now you are all set and we can integrate with taurus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taurus integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the convenient features taurus gives you is the services namely &lt;a href=&quot;https://gettaurus.org/docs/ShellExec/&quot;&gt;shell exec service&lt;/a&gt;. It allows us to execute commands during test execution stages. We are going to use the post-process stage for uploading test results. The taurus configuration can look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; shellexec
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;post-process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; python $PWD/helper/upload&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;kpi.py &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;p $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;PROJECT&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;s $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;SCENARIO&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;e $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;BASE_URL&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;host $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;HOSTNAME&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;ec $TAURUS_EXIT_CODE &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;er &quot;$&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;TAURUS_STOPPING_REASON&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of upload-kpi.py script can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ludeknovy/jtl-reporter/blob/master/scripts/upload_jtl.py&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Do not forget to provide it with api token generated earlier (to avoid 401 error), project and scenario name. I do store them in the same taurus yaml file. The whole taurus yaml file can look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;included-configs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; ./bzt.config.yml
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;settings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;PROJECT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; yourProjectName
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;SCENARIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; yourScenarioName
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;concurrency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;ramp-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 2m
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;hold-for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 30m
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;scenario&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; myScenario

&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; shellexec
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;post-process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; python $PWD/helper/upload&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;kpi.py &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;p $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;PROJECT&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;s $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;SCENARIO&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;e $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;BASE_URL&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;host $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;HOSTNAME&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;ec $TAURUS_EXIT_CODE &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;er &quot;$&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;TAURUS_STOPPING_REASON&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to collect monitoring logs add to your yaml taurus configuration file another service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; monitoring

For some reason, this topic is overlooked by the testing community. You can find lots of resources on how to learn this tool and that framework and which is better than others, but very little has been written on how to tackle test results management. I will try to demonstrate why you should care about test result management too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best open source solution I was able to find is ReportPortal.io, developed by EPAM. ReportPortal is an AI-powered tool allowing you to aggregate and analyze test results and more. With ReportPortal you will leverage your test automation architecture to the next level. It made my life easier especially for these two capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debugging tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debugging tests in ReportPortal got a much easier way than it would be from a CI tool. You know the situation when your tests fail and you have to open your CI and look in very long console output for given error at the very end. And then search for it further until you find your assertion error. And this gets even more frustrating when there is a couple of errors. With ReportPortal you will be able to navigate through your failed test in a more sane way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add a description to a failed scenario and sort them to predefined categories, or extend them by adding your own. Eg. if a test has failed because of timeout you can mark it as “System issue” or if it is an actual product change you put it in the “Product change” category. At the beginning you have to do it manually but once you gather enough data ReportPortal’s AI will do it instead of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you log additional information as communication logs you can send them to ReportPortal as well. This will depend on your test framework integration, but you can either log them directly or add them as an attachment. You will get the assertion error and test logs in one place, with that you will be able to find out what was going on pretty quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tracking history and statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking the history of your test results will allow you to spot repeating problems more easily and thus take further action on preventing them. All that data gathered in ReportPortal gives you more detailed statistic insight into your tests and application under test. You will be able to visualize test coverage, pass/fail ratio, average run time, and more. Regular CI tool history limits your statistics data to pass/fail statistics over a couple of last builds. But that’s it. You do not get statistics on which particular tests have failed. With ReportPortal you will be able to get an overview of most often failing tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReportPortal offers nice graphs but it has two flaws. You can’t share them with anonymous users and you cant group them in one big dashboard across all your projects (public dashboard will be added in the future). Fortunately, ReportPortal has decent APIs (you can find the swagger definition by navigating to the API section in the application) that you can use it to build your own dashboard on top of it as we did in my organization. Thus we can easily share the dashboard with anyone in your team. Our custom dashboard consists of two parts — a general overview and a detailed project view. Overview displays little cards for the last 10 test runs. And if you click on it you will be redirected to the given test run in ReportPortal. Dashboard overview gives us a very quick grasp of current health across all projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A publicly accessible dashboard gives to your automation visibility and it helps to increase test awareness as well. You do not need to send static HTML reports to your manager anymore. Anyone from management, product owners, development team, or stakeholders can have a look at the current state of your product. In case of failing tests they can raise an important question of why some tests are failing, what does it mean for your product and what are you going to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
